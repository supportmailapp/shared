// TypeScript types for the sm-manager public status WebSocket.
//
// These mirror the Go wire types in sm-manager's status.go (ClusterState /
// Event). The statuspage client connects with the browser-native `WebSocket`
// and parses each text frame as JSON into a `StatusEvent`. Keep this file in
// sync with status.go — the JSON tags there are the source of truth. Go cannot
// consume this package, so the sm-manager side stays a hand-mirror against
// PROTOCOL.md.
//
// Connection:
//   const ws = new WebSocket("wss://.../ws?key=<apiKey>");
// The API key may instead be sent via the `X-API-Key` or
// `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header when the client controls headers
// (browsers cannot set headers on WebSocket, so use the `?key=` query param).
